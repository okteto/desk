# Okteto Desk: your work environment extended into your Kubernetes cluster

**Okteto Desk** is about moving your docker-compose workflow to your Kubernetes cluster to:

1. Forget about Docker for Mac/Minikube performance issues. Run at the speed of cloud. You won't ever go back to work locally.
1. Write code as usual, from your favourite IDE.
1. Enable a new level of collaboration by having your development environment accessible by anyone in your team.

**Okteto Desk** helps you achieve this with a mix of kubernetes automation and file synching between your local file system and Kubernetes.

- Get started following our [installation guides](docs/installation.md).
- Check the **Okteto Desk** [CLI reference](docs/cli-reference.md).
- Explore our [getting started guide](example).
